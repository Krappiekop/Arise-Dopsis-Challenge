# Arise-Dopsis-Challenge
Welcome to the Arise-Dopsis Challenge repository. This project is divided into two main parts: Classification and Detection, each focusing on different aspects of insect image processing and analysis.

## About the Arise-Dopsis Challenge
The Arise-Dopsis Challenge aims to develop advanced machine learning models for the detection and classification of insect species from images. The project is divided into two main sections:

1. **Classification**: 
   This section involves training models to accurately classify insect species from given images. Various approaches and models, such as CNN and VGG16, have been explored to improve classification accuracy.

3. **Detection**:
   This section focuses on detecting and annotating insects in images. Techniques like YOLO and VGG16 are used to train models that can identify and annotate insects in large image datasets.

## Repository Structure
- Classification: Contains notebooks and scripts for training and testing classification models.
- Detection: Includes notebooks and scripts for detecting and annotating insects in images.

Each section has its own README file with detailed information on the notebooks and processes involved.

Feel free to explore the repository and the detailed documentation within each section to understand the methods and results of the Arise-Dopsis Challenge.
